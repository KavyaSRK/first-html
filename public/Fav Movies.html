<p>I'm a huge fan of ghibli movies. As an artist myself I really love the beautiful frames in each scene. I could just look at it forever. I love the feeling of nostalgia it evokes in me. It's a beautiful, delicate movie, Also kinda cottage core so I love it.</p>
<h3>Monster House</h3>

<p>It's a movie I watched as akid, suggested by my father so I have a sentimental feel to it. Though we don't celebrate halloween here in India, I'm a huge fan of it.</p>
